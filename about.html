    <p>Buy a car from a local dealership. Search through 17 637 new and used cars that have been listed here on AUTOdealer.co.za

    With so many model variants on the market and the challenge to find cars that suit our needs, car buying has been made nice and easy with our fantastic search tools and options.

    When purchasing a vehicle from a registered dealership, you always have the benefit of mandatory warranties. Always try using your old car as a trade-in for a deposit based upon the value at the time. Car dealerships are usually very happy to offer you the "book" value of your automobile which helps with avoiding having to sell your car privately.

    When purchasing a vehicle, the dealer will usually be able to assist with a vehicle finance application via an in-house F&I consultant. If not, you should go to your bank and enquire about a car loan.

    So, it is now time to find your dream car on AUTOdealer.co.za.</p>
